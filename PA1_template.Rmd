We start with some initial setup, which includes loading packages and setting global `knitr` options:

```{r setup,echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

opts_knit$set(echo=TRUE, comment="")

```


## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r readData}

fitData <- read.csv(file="activity.csv",header = TRUE)

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r stepsPerDay}

# Group the data by day and sum up the steps, removing NA values:
stepsPerDay <- tapply(X = fitData$steps,INDEX = fitData$date,FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)

print(paste0("Mean number of steps per day: ",mean(stepsPerDay)))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
